# Supervised_Machine_Learning
‚Ä¢ Machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn. 
‚Ä¢ Supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression

1. Model_Representation_Soln.py: Implementation of the model  ùëì(ùë§,ùëè)  for linear regression with one variable. This file makes use of tools like NumPy, a popular library for scientific computing and Matplotlib, a popular library for plotting data.
Project: Prediction of house price according to a initial dataset
Problem Statement: simple data set with only two data points - a house with 1000 square feet(sqft) sold for $300,000 and a house with 2000 square feet sold for $500,000. These two points will constitute our data or training set. You would like to fit a linear regression model through these two points, so you can then predict price for other houses - like a house with 1200 sqft.
NOTE: the units of size are 1000 sqft and the units of price are 1000s of dollars.
